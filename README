;;; repo-root.el -- find the root directory of a VCS project

;;; Commentary

;; Finds the root of the project path for Git, SVN and Darcs
;; repositories.

;; This is intended for modules that want to discover the currently
;; edited project with zero configuration required by the user.

;;; TODO:

;; Detection from version control:
;; * RCS
;; * Darcs (implemented, needs unit tests)
;; * Bazaar
;; * Mercurial
;; * MKS

;; Detection from build tools:
;; * lein
;; * sbt
;; * maven
;; * rebar
;; * bundler

;;; Similar projects:

;; * https://github.com/jrockway/eproject has a concept of a generic
;;   project
;; * https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile supports project detection,
;;   or an explicit .projectile file.
;; * http://code.google.com/p/emacs-project-mode/ requires the user to
;;   interactively state their project paths, and saves
;;   ~/.emacs.d/PROJECT-NAME.proj
;;
;; Several others are documented at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryProject
